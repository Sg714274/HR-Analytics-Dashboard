# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
This project presents an in-depth HR Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze employee attrition, identify major contributing factors, and generate insights that help HR teams make better workforce decisions.

Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition data and reveal patterns that HR teams can use to:

Reduce attrition

Enhance recruitment strategies

Strengthen workplace satisfaction

This dashboard visualizes key HR metrics such as attrition count, attrition rate, age distribution, satisfaction scores, job role analysis, and salary-level insights.

🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Before creating the dashboard, the dataset was cleaned and prepared using multiple steps:

✔ 1) Removed Null / Missing Values

Ensured no blank fields in critical columns such as Job Role, Gender, Salary, Education, etc.

✔ 2) Removed Duplicates

Eliminated repeated records to maintain accuracy of attrition rate and analysis.

✔ 3) Corrected Spelling Mistakes

Standardized inconsistent entries such as:

“Travel-agencies” → “Travel Agencies”

Ensured uniformity across categorical columns (Job Role, Department, Education, etc.)
